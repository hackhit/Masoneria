## NOTICE: Experiencing GitHub push/fetch problems?

As of 22 Feb 2018, [GitHub has disabled support for weak encryption](https://githubengineering.com/crypto-deprecation-notice/) which means many users will suddenly find themselves unable to authenticate using a Git for Windows which (impacts versions older than v2.16.0). **DO NOT PANIC**, there's a fix. [Update Git for Windows](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases) to the latest (or at least v2.16.0).
